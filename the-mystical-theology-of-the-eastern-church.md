* Title: The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church
* Author: Vladimir Lossky

## Introduction

There's a general sense where some distinguish the Church's institution and its
theology in opposition to its practice and mystical experience. The two, for
those, are opposed for the first is static, dogmatic, and the second is dynamic,
personal.

In the Eastern Church, there's no sharp distinction between its theology and
mystical experience. One is the rule of the other: theology is what delimitates
the common experience of the Church, separating the wheat from the chaff of
what is truth and what is falsehood in experience. The mystical experience of
the Church, then, is what is translated into theology, translating personal
experience into theology. Thus, the ones called theologians in EO --- St. John
the Theologian, St. Gregory Nazienzen and St. Symean the New Theologian --- are
all mystical writers.

Different than the gnostic tradition, Eastern Christianity has always had
theological knowledge not as an end goal, but as a mean of union to God. Thus,
any theology serves only as a description and deliniation of how one achieves
the central goal of Christianity, which is to be in union with the Godhead. All
of the councils, when defining the core tenets of the faith, are making
important distinctions that make clearer the path of deification, the "theosis"
of the Church Fathers.
