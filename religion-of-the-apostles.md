+ Title: Religion of the Apostles
+ Author: Fr. Stephen de Young

## Preface

In scholar studies, there's the impression that early apostolic Christianity was
simple, where people reunited at their homes, listened to teachings and didn't
have any dogma besides Jesus being the Messiah and dying for our sins. Thus,
Catholicism and Orthodoxy are seen as later developments. The goal of the book
is to argue that most of what is seen as such was there in the beginning.

It will show the continuity between the OT and NT by putting them in context
with Second Temple Judaism (STJ), characterized as a multitude of faith
expressions existent in the intertestamental period, from 500 BC to 70 AC. This
often is not done by scholars, who assume that the Judaism of that period was
the same of the Rabbinical period, which, in fact, was developed at 500 AC, as a
response to Christianity. The book will show how Christianity and Judaism
weren't separate religions, but, in early periods, an addition of what people
came to comprehend Jesus was in relation to the rest of Jewish culture, being a
continuous evolution, instead of a new religion from scratch.

## Introduction: Paul, a convert?

Often, Paul, in light of a dichotomy later proposed in the Reformation
characterized by a fight between Law and Gospel, is said to be a convert. He,
when speaking of his call to be an apostle, always talks about his vision in the
road to Damascus. It is a parallel of Isaiah's vision, where he sees Yahweh in
His throne calling him to preach to Israel, and Ezekiel's vision, where he sees
the chariot of God, and where he receives the calling to be a preacher to the
nations. Paul lived in a period where "Merkabah" (which means "Chariot" in
Hebrew) mysticism was practiced in Judaism. It consisted of prayerful life,
where people could experience visions like the one Ezekiel had by reciting the
Shema (which would later evolve into hesychasm with the Jesus prayer). Along
that, there were writings. They developed a vocabulary to talk about heaven,
which was understood to have seven levels, and that one should work to ascend.
Paul seems to be a practitioner  of the Merkabah tradition. In 2 Cor. 12 he
talks about a vision he received of the "third heaven", and his vision of Jesus
on the road to Damascus is analogous to Ezekiel's one, where he sees Christ as
God (In the Merkabah tradition, some would see the Angel of the Lord in a
throne.) and receives his call to be an apostle. Indeed, all apostles, and the
seventy sent to preach, were directly appointed by Christ, and some were
appointed to other tasks. (Christ had many more followers than the apostle and
the seventy sent to preach.) Thus, Paul, as the prophets, saw his call as a
continuation of his professing faith; a revelation that should be further
announced to his brothers.

About the Law: to Paul, Christ was the Law giver. He didn't want to abolish it,
but advocated that we could fulfill it, in a way we could never do by ourselves,
with the help of the Holy Spirit, which is prophesied in multiple places in the
OT. With the Spirit, we can bear fruit that even surpasses the Law expectations.
(Gal. 5) That was the establishment of the New Covenant.

## Chapter 1: Divine Father and Son

Scholars, even Orthodox, generally assume that early Christians were
monotheistic Unitarians. The author defends that they believed God existed in
multiple hypostases. ("Substances".) Pre-Christian Jews believed God had
"multiple bodies". That was a subject of debate, where there were analogous
positions to Arianism, where the exalted person was Moses, Enoch, etc. At the
Christian dawn, these ideas weren't considered heretical to Jews. Only in the
2nd century they were, in response to Christian claims.

### Subtitle: The Angel of the Lord

The Angel of the Lord is a figure which appears multiple times throughout the
Bible. The author lists three. The first is when he appears to Moses inside the
burning bush. The Angel after refers to himself as Yahweh. The second account is
when he appears to Gideon. Gideon receives the Angel, which talked as being
Yahweh, with hospitality. Only after He disappears, Gideon realizes it was the
Lord. The third example is of Israel's guide in the desert. Yahweh said He would
send His Angel, and would put His Name in Him. This is an expression that means
Yahweh would be present there. He uses the same expression with the Temple,
which indicates His Divine Presence. Yahweh, later, says Himself guided the
israelites through the desert. Paul also links the Angel with Christ (1 Cor.
10:3, 4), and Jude does as well. (Jude 1:5)

### Subtitle: The Word of God

Generally, St. John's gospel prologue is interpreted as presenting an evolution
of Christolog, from a "low" one, which only saw Jesus as the human Messiah, to a
"high" one, where Christ is seen as the divine Logos. "Logos" is generally taken
in philosophical terms as a hypstasis of God, which mediates Him with the world
and His creation. Philo, a jewish philosopher, had this view of the Logos in the
Hebrew tradition. He also believed the Word was the Angel of the Lord and
God-begotten. The general interpretation of it being a "development"
misinterprets the Scriptures. "The Word" is a Person which frequently appears in
the OT and is identified as Yahweh Himself. The first account is in Gen. 15,
where the Word appears to Abraham in a "vision". Abraham calls this Person "the
Lord Yahweh". The second appearance, or, better said, lack of it, is in 1 Sam.
3:1. There, it says the Word of Yahweh had become rare, and people weren't given
"visions". In the context, further it is said that the _Word of Yahweh had not
been revealed_ to Samuel yet. In v. 10, Yahweh _takes His position_ next to
Samuel to call him. In v. 21, it says "Yahweh began to appear again", and that
Yahweh was revealed by His Word. Furthermore, in Jer. 1, the Word of Yahweh
comes to him (v. 4), and it further identifies as "Yahweh" (v. 7). The Person
touches Jeremiah's mouth (v. 9), once again showing as, not just a heard word,
but a tangible being. Jeremiah's account is similar to Paul's in Gal. 1:11-16,
where he says God had chosen him from his mother's womb, (Comp. with Jer. 1:5)
in which Christ appears as the speaker, a connection between the Word of Yahweh
and Christ, the incarnate Logos. The last account and bridge is Psalm 33:6,
where it says that the heavens were made "through the Word of Yahweh", and that
its armies "proceed from His breath". The Hebrew word for "breath" is "ruach",
which also means "Spirit" in other contexts. In Gen. 1, the Spirit of Yahweh is
present hovering over the water, and things are created from the Word of Yahweh.
John, when in his prologue says that the Word is the mean through what all
creation came to be, is reflecting the knowledge he acquired from Christ about
the Hebrew Scriptures. His view is not inconsistent with Jewish thought in the
tradition from the Second Temple. In some written traditions from this period,
the text would present "Memra" (Hebrew word which means "word".) capitalized
when, in context, it referred to Yahweh, to indicate it as the Second Person of
God. Even in contemporary Rabbinical tradition it is a common practice. This is
done where Yahweh appears to humans.
