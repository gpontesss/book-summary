# Demonstration of the Apostolic Preaching

TODO: later transcribe everything here.

45. Jacob, in His dream, saw the Son in the top of the Stairway to Heaven. We
    ascend because of His passion. It couldn't be the Father. The Son since
    always, according to the Divine porpuse, revealed the knowledge of God to
    mankind.
46. The Son appeared to Moses in the burning bush. He speaks as seeing the
    suffering of His people. He's the one working miracles, like water flowing
    from a stone. Indeed, He is the stone which produced twelve fountains, the
    Apostles. He's the one to lead us to the Father.
47. Father and Son are Lord and God, for whom is begotten from God is also God.
    By His essence, God is only One. His economy on revealing Himself requires
    the Son to reveal the Father, the invisible God. God is the Son's throne,
    according to David's Psalm. The Son is anointed with the Holy Spirit along
    with His equals, those being the prophets, apostles and members of the
    Kindgom.
48. Psalm 110 referring to Christ's "coming to existence", dominion over the
    nations, judgment of His enemies, who persecute His name, being immortal and
    His glorious assumption.
49. Son is the subject of Psalm 2, not David. Cited Psam 110 again. The Holy
    Spirit is what inspired prophets, sometimes speaking in Name of the Father,
    sometimes in Name of the Son. (He seems to personify the Holy Spirit.)
50. The Son is preexistent and is referred by Isaiah.
51. Son is preexistent and was made seen by man before He was born like a man.
    Before being born, He was proclaimed Lord of all men. Was said to be born of
    the Spirit of God. The Son is obedient to the Father, as every son of man
    is.
52. The rest of Scripture says that same: that the Son of God, the one that was
    before the creation of the world along the Father's bosom, is the same who
    walked among men in communion with them.
53. Isaiah's prophecy of the virginal birth of Christ, indicating that He would
    be a man. He's called anointed for the Holy Spirit of God resided in Him,
    which is also foretold by the Son Himself in Isaiah. He's called Savior for
    is through Him that every man may be delivered from death.
54. Christ is called by Isaiah "Emmanuel", which means "God among us". Indeed,
    Christ being God resided among man; He's destined to it. Isaiah prophesied
    that Mary's birth would be painless. Isaiah also says that He would be
    called "Mighty God".
55. Christ is called "Wonderful Counselor", for He was beside God in Creation.
    In Gen., the Father talks to the Son about creating Man in their image. He
    counsels the Father, as well as us, mankind. He can do it for He's God. He
    leads us to immortality and wisdom.
56. Those who knew Christ and didn't believe in Him are condemned to the eternal
    fire. Those who did not know Him, as did the patriarches, will be judged
    according to their deeds. ("Angel of the great counsel of God"? What does it
    mean?) The cross is a symbol of His sovereignty.
57. Christ said to come from the tribe of Judah. After Him, there was no jewish
    King, for the Romans took control. His blood is the "blood of grapes", which
    is a work of God, that saves the ones who are washed by it. Indeed, to drink
    of His blood is to receive the Spirit. "We expect of Him the restauration of
    the Kindgom". (Here, it seems to show that Ireneaus believed in the
    Millenium.)
58. Moses' prophecy talks about the star of Judah becoming chief. This is a sign
    fulfilled in Christ coming from Judah's tribe and, in His birth, by the star
    which guided the Mages to Bethlehem to find Christ.
59. Christ said to come from Abraham and David's lineage, according to Isaiah's
    prophecy corcerning the "sprout". Mary is said to be the sprout. In Moses,
    the staff/stick is a sign of power. Christ has the staff/stick.
60. Isaiah's prophecy shows Christ's divinity through His merciful and impartial
    judgement. He, as the Word of God, does everything which is His Father's
    will. He will execute judgement for the Father. It also indicates His human
    form by talking about parts of His body.
