# Demonstration of the Apostolic Preaching

TODO: later transcribe everything here.

45. Jacob, in His dream, saw the Son in the top of the Stairway to Heaven. We
    ascend because of His passion. It couldn't be the Father. The Son since
    always, according to the Divine porpuse, revealed the knowledge of God to
    mankind.
46. The Son appeared to Moses in the burning bush. He speaks as seeing the
    suffering of His people. He's the one working miracles, like water flowing
    from a stone. Indeed, He is the stone which produced twelve fountains, the
    Apostles. He's the one to lead us to the Father.
47. Father and Son are Lord and God, for whom is begotten from God is also God.
    By His essence, God is only One. His economy on revealing Himself requires
    the Son to reveal the Father, the invisible God. God is the Son's throne,
    according to David's Psalm. The Son is anointed with the Holy Spirit along
    with His equals, those being the prophets, apostles and members of the
    Kindgom.
48. Psalm 110 referring to Christ's "coming to existence", dominion over the
    nations, judgment of His enemies, who persecute His name, being immortal and
    His glorious assumption.
49. Son is the subject of Psalm 2, not David. Cited Psam 110 again. The Holy
    Spirit is what inspired prophets, sometimes speaking in Name of the Father,
    sometimes in Name of the Son. (He seems to personify the Holy Spirit.)
50. The Son is preexistent and is referred by Isaiah.
51. Son is preexistent and was made seen by man before He was born like a man.
    Before being born, He was proclaimed Lord of all men. Was said to be born of
    the Spirit of God. The Son is obedient to the Father, as every son of man
    is.
52. The rest of Scripture says that same: that the Son of God, the one that was
    before the creation of the world along the Father's bosom, is the same who
    walked among men in communion with them.
53. Isaiah's prophecy of the virginal birth of Christ, indicating that He would
    be a man. He's called anointed for the Holy Spirit of God resided in Him,
    which is also foretold by the Son Himself in Isaiah. He's called Savior for
    is through Him that every man may be delivered from death.
54. Christ is called by Isaiah "Emmanuel", which means "God among us". Indeed,
    Christ being God resided among man; He's destined to it. Isaiah prophesied
    that Mary's birth would be painless. Isaiah also says that He would be
    called "Mighty God".
55. Christ is called "Wonderful Counselor", for He was beside God in Creation.
    In Gen., the Father talks to the Son about creating Man in their image. He
    counsels the Father, as well as us, mankind. He can do it for He's God. He
    leads us to immortality and wisdom.
56. Those who knew Christ and didn't believe in Him are condemned to the eternal
    fire. Those who did not know Him, as did the patriarches, will be judged
    according to their deeds. ("Angel of the great counsel of God"? What does it
    mean?) The cross is a symbol of His sovereignty.
57. Christ said to come from the tribe of Judah. After Him, there was no jewish
    King, for the Romans took control. His blood is the "blood of grapes", which
    is a work of God, that saves the ones who are washed by it. Indeed, to drink
    of His blood is to receive the Spirit. "We expect of Him the restauration of
    the Kindgom". (Here, it seems to show that Ireneaus believed in the
    Millenium.)
58. Moses' prophecy talks about the star of Judah becoming chief. This is a sign
    fulfilled in Christ coming from Judah's tribe and, in His birth, by the star
    which guided the Mages to Bethlehem to find Christ.
59. Christ said to come from Abraham and David's lineage, according to Isaiah's
    prophecy corcerning the "sprout". Mary is said to be the sprout. In Moses,
    the staff/stick is a sign of power. Christ has the staff/stick.
60. Isaiah's prophecy shows Christ's divinity through His merciful and impartial
    judgement. He, as the Word of God, does everything which is His Father's
    will. He will execute judgement for the Father. It also indicates His human
    form by talking about parts of His body.
61. Isaiah's prophecy talks about animals living in peace together. This is an
    analogy to how disciples of Christ can deeply change from ruthless animals
    to meek ones. Also, it talks about Christ's rising from the dead in His
    resurrection. He is risen as God. (Is there a difference between "as" and
    "by" in Greek? Or could it be an either/or situation that depends on the
    translator?)
62. Isaiah calls Christ's body "a tent". That prefigures he being a man on the
    outside, but God in power, the judge of the Universe.
63. Micah's prophecy complements the davidic virginal birth from Isaiah: Christ
    should come from Bethlehem.
64. Messiah was to come after David, since his Kindgom was not everlasting.
    Prophecies show that people should look for the Messiah among the tribe of
    Judah, that should come from Bethlehem.
65. Isaiah's prophecy: "Daughter of Zion" is a name for Jerusalem; Christ enters
    the "Daughter of Zion" in an ass.
66. Prophets foretold Christ's birth place, that He would be the King of
    Eternity, the cures He would perform and His suffering and death.
67. Isaiah's prophecies about Jesus' miracles: cures for the disabled, the
    blind, the deaf, and resurrections. (Note on the Holy Spirit: it seems to
    talk in prophecies as things already happened. He does so for for God things
    planned are considered to have already happened.)
68. Christ's passion foretold by Isaiah, David and Jeremiah: He would suffer for
    our sins, even though no error was found in Him. David talks about being
    tortured, but He said it meaning Christ, as told by the Verb to him. (Christ
    is called "Yahweh's arm".)
69. Isaiah's prophecy about Christ's silent sufferring. His death is a sentence
    taken in behalf of the just men, so they can be saved; the wicked shall take
    the sentence themselves, being condemned to suffer after the end of this
    world.
70. Isaiah's warning to not reject Christ for His passion and suffering, but to
    fear His "birth", that is, the One that is His origin: the Father.
71. Jeremiah's testifies Jesus' passion. His shadow is a type for His body, made
    by the Spirit. The body was a shadow for what was behind it, His great
    Spirit. Just as a shadown is trodden by others, Christ was "trodden" in His
    passion. His shadow was capable of curing people.
72. Isaiah talks about Christ's Tomb being source of peace. The ones who were
    previously adversaries to the jews would be united to them by their Faith in
    the Lord. Quotes Psalm 21 to talk about his immortality after His
    resurrection. (It seems that only Ireneaus, in the Christian Antiquity, used
    this Psalm.)
73. David, in Psalm 3, talks about Jesus' resurrection. Christ, to whom the
    Spirit that inspired the prophets belongs to, inspired David. "Sleep" is a
    metaphor for death.
74. David's Psalm (3) talks about people being against Yahweh and His anointed.
    Pilates, (by Ireneaus mistake, wrongly assigned as procurator of Claudius
    Caesar, instead of Tiberius), controlled by Herod, king of the jews,
    condemned Jesus, for He was called King, though not of this world. Herod
    feared losing His kingship for going against Caesar.
75. Christ's passion by the will of the Father foretold by David in Psalm 89.
76. Zacariah foretold the spreading of the disciples after Christ's death. 
77. Oseiah foretold handing of Christ as a gift. Pilate sent Christ to be
    interrogated by Herod.
78. Jeremiah foretold Christ's descent to Hades, to save those in there, and to
    preach the Good News to them. That was the porpuse of His death. (About the
    passage, it seems to not be in our Bibles, but both Justin Martyr and
    Ireneaus use it. Justin seems to say it was expurged by the jews.)
79. Isaiah and Psalms 22 and 119 are cited to support Christ's suffering in the
    cross. Also Deuteronomy 28.
80. Job has a passage that foretells the parting of His clothes among the
    soldiers, and the raffle of His tunic.
81. Zacariah and Jeremiah's prophecies about Christ being betrayed by 30 silver
    coins and the money being used to buy a piece of land.
82. David's prophecy in Psalm 69 about Christ being fed vinegar.
83. Psalm 68 foretold Christ's ascent to Heaven. He put an end to slavery, which
    refers to the destruction of the evil angels. (This is part of the true
    Gospel, according to Stephen Damick. It can be correlated with "slavery to
    sin", which seems to come from these evil ones. A deeper discussion on what
    sin is should be required to go further.) After the resurrection of the dead
    (note that he takes Mat. 27 account of the dead coming out of the tombs
    literally), Christ appeared to the disciples in the Mount of Olives and then
    ascended to Heaven. They saw the Heavens "open".
84. David, in Psalm 24, foretells Christ's ascent to Heaven. Gates, in the
    Psalm, are the ones in Heaven. Angels are the ones pronouncing the command
    to open the gates. (Interesting that the King of Glory in the Psalm is
    Yahweh. Ireneaus should know this, and, yet, chose to use it as referring to
    Christ. There you also see Yahweh only being called "Mighty", and not
    Almighty, as Christ is called in Isaiah 9.)
85. Christ is sitting at the Right Hand of the Father waiting for His enemies to
    be defeated. These are rebel angels that despise the Truth. David foretold
    it in Psalm 110.
86. Apostles preached Christ's death and His defeat of Death. Preaching foretold
    by Isaiah 52. Isaiah 2 said that "Yahweh's Word" would come from Jerusalem.
    Preaching to all nations foretold by Psalm 19.
87. Ireneaus affirms that Law argumentation can't save anyone, but only charity
    and love, since the two greater commandments involve love and are the
    completion of the entire Law according to the Lord. This is the "brief word"
    sent to the whole world, foretold in Isaiah 10.
